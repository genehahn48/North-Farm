# North-Farm
UKY North Farm fields for Plant and Soil Sciences
Create user interactive map for Faculty and Staff to locate users of fields at the Spindletop North Farm. 
The map shows the North Farm boundary in black, field boundaries in red, and soil mapping units in brown. 
The Carto interactive map will show hover above field the principal investigator(PI) for that filed and field number. 
Also if the user clicks in the field boundary the name of PI, email, contact phone #, and field # will appear.
